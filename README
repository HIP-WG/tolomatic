Here's how we're going to build PhyloTastic:
* Take a very big tree (example: the ToLWeb XML dump)
* For each tip, compute its path to the root
* Write that path out as a tab-delimited list of node names
* Using map.pl, given a list of taxa, emit matching paths as a list of parent-child pairs
* Using the reducer, retain unique parent-child pairs
* Place those into a template for NeXML

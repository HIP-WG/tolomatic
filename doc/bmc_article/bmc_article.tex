\begin{abstract}
        % Do not use inserted blank lines (ie \\) until main body of text.
        \paragraph*{Background:} Here we say some interesting stuff about
        the growing body of megatrees, their application in many research
        fields and the need for good tools for pruning these trees down to the
        set of taxa of interest. We then say that MapReduce is a design 
        pattern that till now has not been applied to phylogenetic tree 
        pruning but that we've come up with a way to leverage it.
      
        \paragraph*{Results:} Here we say that we've implemented our algorithm
        in perl and in clojure and that it yields good results.

        \paragraph*{Conclusions:} We conclude that this is a potentially
        valuable contribution, especially in combination with a software
        stack for taxonomic name resolution upstream and taxonomic grafting
        downstream (a la phylomatic).

\section*{Background}
% Points to make:
% 	- usefulness of phylogenies in a variety of fields
% 	- growing body of megatrees
% 	- barriers to their application 
% 	- popularity of phylomatic
% 	- tree pruning as a phylotastic component
% 	- different implementations of tree pruning in phylotastic
% 	- the MapReduce design pattern
% 	- the Hadoop framework
% 	- our application of MapReduce/Hadoop to tree pruning
Phylogenetic trees find application in a variety of research fields such as
orthology assignment, gene function prediction, systematics, biodiversity 
informatics and evolutionary comparative analysis. Due to this increasingly 
broad application, more and more researchers whose expertise and research 
interests lie outside of phylogenetics find themselves needing to obtain 
reasonable approximations of phylogeny. At the same time, experts on the 
methodology of phylogenetic inference have been constructing larger and 
larger trees ("megatrees") of, among other higher taxa, mammals (ref), 
fishes (ref) and angiosperms (ref) while community projects on classification 
have resulted in tree-like artefacts such as the NCBI taxonomy (ref), the 
skeleton of the Tree of Life Web Project (ref) and the "green genes" tree (ref). 
However, a recent survey of community practices (ref) has indicated that there 
are considerable barriers to re-use of these megatrees by non-experts. Among 
these barriers is the dearth of tools to prune such trees down to the set of 
taxa of interest. The "Phylomatic" tool (ref), which by default operates on the 
APG3 composite estimate of phylogeny, is the main exception to this situation as 
it provides a convenient way for researchers to obtain subtrees (usually of 
plants) that can be applied towards towards their research questions - which 
explain Phylomatic's popularity as observed in the survey (ref). Noting the 
usefulness of Phylomatic, biologists and informaticists have teamed 
up to formalize a design pattern subsequent to which they are developing a 
standards-compliant "stack" of web services that provides more generalized 
functionality of taxonomic name resolution, tree pruning and grafting, branch 
length estimation and data integration: "Phylotastic". Participants in this
collaboration have developed tree pruning functionality using a variety of
approaches, including triple store and RDBMS queries and implementations in
several open source programming toolkits for phyloinformatics (e.g. DendroPy (ref),
Bio::Phylo (ref), ...). This process also resulted in the development of a tree
pruning algorithm that leverages the MapReduce design pattern for massively 
parallel data analysis (ref). MapReduce is a simple pattern originally developed
by Google that consists of - at a minimum - two steps. In the first step, input
data are transformed by "mappers" into meaningful key/value pairs. As these 
mappers operate in a trivially parallel way, the same key may be emitted multiple 
times (possibly with different values). These emitted result are subsequently 
aggregated into a single datum comprised of a key associated with a list of 
all values observed for that key, and this datum is then passed to the next
step, where parallelized "reducers" whittle down each datum (i.e. a single key
and a list of values) to zero or more key/value pairs. In an optional third
step, "combiners" then operate on these key/value pairs to obtain a final result.
In recent years, MapReduce has found application in some areas of "big data
biology", for example in the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK, ref), where it is
applied to parallelized traversal of aligned short reads obtained by high-throughput
shotgun sequencing ("next generation sequencing"). Here we present a tree pruning
algorithm that operates on megatrees, returning a result in reasonable time by
employing MapReduce-based parallelization. We have implemented this algorithm in
two programming languages (Perl and Clojure) and have launched a prototype web
service (ref - location) that allows users to harvest subtrees from several 
published megatrees.
